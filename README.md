# Wordle Bot

My attempt at a wordle solver. Utilizes information theory to score the best next word based on
the expected information gained from them and reports when a 100% probability winning word is found.

At the time of writing,
https://wordly.org/ is where I primarily test this bot as it allows you to play as many times in a day as you want
